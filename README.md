# Operating System Algorithms and Concepts

## Introduction
Welcome to the Operating System Code Repository! This GitHub repository showcases various fundamental operating system algorithms and concepts implemented in C++. These code examples aim to provide insights into how these algorithms work and their relevance in handling different scenarios.

## Algorithms and Concepts Included

### Deadlock Avoidance and Detection
1. Banker's Algorithm: Implementation of the Banker's algorithm for deadlock avoidance in resource allocation.
2. Peterson's Solution: Code for Peterson's algorithm used for synchronization and mutual exclusion.

### Multi-Threaded and Chat Server
1. Multi-Threaded Chat Server: Implementation of a chat server that supports multiple clients concurrently using threads.

### Fork and Process Synchronization
1. Fork Usage - If-Else, Sum, and Sorting: Examples demonstrating the use of fork for different tasks such as conditional execution, summing numbers, and sorting.
2. CPU Scheduling: Implementation of CPU scheduling algorithms like Round Robin, Shortest Job First (SJF), etc.
3. Semaphore: Code for using semaphores to synchronize processes and manage shared resources.
4. All Reader-Writer Problems: Solving various reader-writer problems with different solutions.

### Sleeping TA and Pizza Delivery
1. Sleeping TA: Concept applied to simulate a scenario of students waiting for a Teaching Assistant (TA) while the TA sleeps until a student arrives.
2. Pizza Delivery: A practical application of the Sleeping TA concept in the context of pizza delivery, where customers place orders and delivery agents process them.

### Process Synchronization and Dining Philosophers
1. Process Synchronization: Implementations of different process synchronization mechanisms to manage concurrent access to shared resources.
2. Dining Philosophers: Solving the classic dining philosophers problem with different solutions.

### Thread and Mutex in Matrix Operations
1. Thread and Mutex Usage in Matrix Operations: Examples showcasing the usage of threads and mutex to perform matrix operations concurrently.

### Producer-Consumer Problem
1. Producer-Consumer Problem: Implementation of the producer-consumer problem using threads for concurrent production and consumption.
